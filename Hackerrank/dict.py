# The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict)
# container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet.
# If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what 
# you want.

# For example:  
# from collections import defaultdict
# d = defaultdict(list)
# d['python'].append("awesome")
# d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
# d['python'].append("language")
# for i in d.items():
#     print i
# This prints:
# ('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
# ('something-else', ['not relevant'])
# In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers, n and m. There are n words, which might repeat, in word group A.
# There are m words belonging to word group B. For each m words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not.
# Print the indices of each occurrence of m in group A. If it does not appear, print -1.

# Input Format
# The first line contains integers, n and m separated by a space.
# The next n lines contains the words belonging to group A.
# The next m lines contains the words belonging to group B.

# Constraints
# 1 <= n <= 10000
# 1 <= m <= 100
# 1 <= length of each word in the input <= 100

# Output Format
# Output m lines.
# The i-th line should contain the 1-indexed positions of the occurrences of the i-th word separated by spaces.

# Sample Input
# 5 2
# a
# a
# b
# a
# b
# a
# b

# Sample Output
# 1 2 4
# 3 5

# Explanation
# 'a' appeared 3 times in positions 1, 2 and 4.
# 'b' appeared 2 times in positions 3 and 5.
# In the sample problem, if 'c' also appeared in word group B, you would print -1.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from collections import defaultdict
n,m = map(int,input().split())
d = defaultdict(list)
for i in range(n):
    d[input()].append(i+1)
for i in range(m):
     print(*d[input()] or [-1])
    #  or
    # s=input()
    # if s in d:
    #     print(*d[s] or [-1])
    
# d[input()] 
# check  s exits   as a key in d, then the index occurrences of the word exists in group A and 
# thus we print the values  of the word in the defaultdict d.
#The * in the print functions enables us to print the value(s) of a list in form of a string, that is, without commas and square brackets.

#If s doesnâ€™t exist as a key then we print -1.
