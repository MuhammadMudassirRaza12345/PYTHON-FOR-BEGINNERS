    "# Anonymous/Lambda Functions In Python\n",
    "- As we have studied function in the previous lecture, we know that if a program has a large piece of code that is required to be executed repeatedly, then it will be better to implement that piece of code as a function. Functions improve code reusability, modularity, and integrity.\n",

    "- In this tutorial, we will see how to declare Anonymous functions and how to return values from them.\n",

    "- def function_name ():\n",
    "- What is Anonymous function?\n",
    "- In Python programming, an anonymous function or lambda expression is a function definition that is not bound to an identifier (def).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The anonymous function is an inline function. The anonymous functions are created using a lambda operator and cannot contain multiple expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The following example will show how anonymous functions work: \n",

    "- result = lambda n1, n2, n3: n1 + n2 + n3;\n",
    "- print (\"Sum of three values : \", result( 10, 20, 25 ))"

    "In the above code, we have created an anonymous function that adds three numbers. The function is stored in a variable named result. The function can then be called using this variable. In the above code, the function has been called with three different parameter values for the function call.\n",

    "Anonymous functions can accept inputs and return the outputs, just like other functions do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we use Python Lambda Functions?\n",
    "The main objective of anonymous functions is that, when we need a function just once, anonymous functions come in handy. Lambda operator is not only used to create anonymous functions, but there are many other uses of the lambda expression. We can create anonymous functions wherever they are needed. Due to this reason, Python Lambda Functions are also called as throw-away functions which are used along with other predefined functions such as reduce(), filter(), and map(). \n",

    "\n",
    "Python has an in-built method i.e. sort(), which is used to sort the elements of the given list in a specified ascending or descending order. There is also a built-in function i.e. sorted(), that builds a new sorted list from an iterable like list, dictionary, etc.\n",
